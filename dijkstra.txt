Dijkstra on an unweighted simple graph

initial node

create fringe (priorityqueue/heap?)
create distances hashmap
create prev hashmap
create done hashmap
initialize distances and done to null and false

set prev[initial] to initial
add initial to done

for neighbors of initial:
set distances[neighbor] to 1
set prev[neighbor] to initial
add neighbor to the fringe


while fringe is not empty
	select smallest from the fringe
	
	get neighbors of smallest
	for neighbors of smallest:
		if done[neighbor]:
			continue
		if distances[neighbor] == null:
			distances[neighbor] = distances[smallest]+1
			prev[neighbor] = smallest
			add neighbor to fringe
		else:
			if distances[smallest]+1 < distances[neighbor]:
				distances[neighbor] = distances[smallest]+1
				prev[neighbor] = smallest

	remove smallest from the fringe
	remove smallest from distances
	add smallest to done
	
	if smallest == destination:
		break

Algorithm for school subgraph problem:
create new subgraph
for each node:
	create new queue
	if node is not in subgraph and node.getSchool == school:
		push onto queue
		add node to subgraph
		while queue is not empty:
			deque item
			for every neighbor of item:
				if neighbor.getSchool == school:
					if not in subgraph:
						push onto queue
						add to subgraph

					connect item and neighbor
